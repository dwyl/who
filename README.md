# *Who*? 

The **quick _answer_** 
to the question: 
**_Who_ is in the `@dwyl` community?**

# **`TODO`**: re-generate the "wall of faces" using latest data

![face wall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/28011265-a95f52d4-6559-11e7-823e-6133d947921a.jpg)


# *Why*? 

We needed a easy/fast way 
to keep track
of who is joining
the `@dwyl` community
so that we can 
see the growth over time. 📈

The [**start-here** > ***who***](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/tree/8bbd28d2ab0c3b5a2a266a1e41fd160fc6ee3038#who) 
section is *woefully* out of date.  
(_this was 
[noted](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/9) 
a while back... 
but sadly was not made 
a priority at the time..._)  
This mini-project addresses 
[dwyl/start-here/issues/9](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/9)

# *What*?

There are **_two_ ways** 
of discovering 
the list of people 
contributing to the 
**dwyl mission**:
## 1. *dwyl* Org's *People Page* on GitHub

Visit: https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/people and grab the list.  
*simple. effective. incomplete*.  
(*read on to understand why this list only scratches the surface!*)

## 2. List all Contributors to dwyl repos on GitHub

Read the Commit History for all the dwyl repos on GitHub
and extract the names of people ... 

As you can imagine, 
this second option 
is _painful_ to do _manually_ ... ⏳

So we _had_ to create an mini-App to do it for us! 💡

# *How*?

We built this mini-App 
using the 
[**`PETAL`** Stack](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/#the-petal-stack)
because we feel it's 
the _fastest_ 
and most _effective_ way
to ship a web app.

## Build Log 👷‍♀️

If you want to **understand _every_ step**
of the process of **_building_** the **mini-app**,
read: 
[**`BUILDIT.md`**](https://github.com/dwyl/who/blob/main/BUILDIT.md)


## _Run_ the App!

To _run_ the App,
you will need to have
`Elixir`
and
`Postgres`
installed.

## Contributing 👩‍💻

All contributions 
from typo fixes
to feature requests
are always welcome! 🙌

Please start by: <br />
a. **Star** the repo on GitHub 
  so you have a "bookmark" you can return to. ⭐ <br />
b. **Fork** the repo 
  so you have a copy you can "hack" on. 🍴 <br />
c. **Clone** the repo to your `localhost` 
  and run it! (see below) 👩‍💻 <br />
