# *Who*? 

The **quick _answer_** 
to the question: 
**_Who_ is in the `@dwyl` community?**

# **`TODO`**: re-generate the "wall of faces" using latest data

# *Why*? 

We needed a easy/fast way 
to keep track
of who is joining
the `@dwyl` community
so that we can 
see the growth over time. üìà

The [**start-here** > ***who***](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/tree/8bbd28d2ab0c3b5a2a266a1e41fd160fc6ee3038#who) 
section is *woefully* out of date.  
(_this was 
[noted](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/issues/9)

# *What*?

There are **_two_ ways** 
of discovering 
the list of people 
contributing to the 
**dwyl mission**:
## 1. *dwyl* Org's *People Page* on GitHub

Visit: https://github.com/orgs/dwyl/people and grab the list.  
*simple. effective. incomplete*.  
(*read on to understand why this list only scratches the surface!*)

## 2. List all Contributors to dwyl repos on GitHub

Read the Commit History for all the dwyl repos on GitHub
and extract the names of people ... 

As you can imagine, 
this second option 
is _painful_ to do _manually_ ... ‚è≥

So we _had_ to create an mini-App to do it for us! üí°

# *How*?

We built our mini-App using the 
[**`PETAL`** Stack](https://github.com/dwyl/technology-stack/#the-petal-stack)
because we feel that it's 
the _fastest_ way
to ship a web app.



To _run_ the App,
